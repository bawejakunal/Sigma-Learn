## Sigma Learn

Classroom learning is key to a studentâ€™s knowledge. Ensuring efficient learning without distractions and aiding the disabled students was our key motivation for developing this application.

Our application records a professors speech and converts it to text in real time. It is an efficient application that enhances note taking by providing the summarisation feature accompanied by an assist that can aid a student understand any word that he does not understand. The application also provides videos relevant to the content to enable audio visual learning. Further, we provide relevant news articles to enable one to remain abreast with the current trends.
The application will not only serve as a one stop learning solution but also serve as a saviour for the differentially abled.
